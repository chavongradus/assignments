# Assignment 1

First load the `tidyverse` package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


##  Assignment 1a

Read the data file _graded_assignment_2.csv_ from disk:

```{r}
data1 <- 
  read.csv("~/Desktop/Programming/Sourcedata/graded_assignment_2.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")
head(data1)
```

## Assignment 1b

Add column _Health_status_ with containing values _1_ (Healthy) and _0_ (Unhealthy).
A person is Healthy, when `FKG` equals 0 and `DKG` equals 0.

So

| FKG | DKG | Health_status   |
|-----|-----|--------------   |
| 0   | 0   | 1               |
| 1   | 0   | 0               |
| 0   | 1   | 0               |
| 1   | 1   | 0               |

Hint: you can use `ifelse()`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data2 <- data1 %>%
  mutate(Health_status = ifelse(FKG + DKG == 0, 1, 0))
head(data2)
  
```

In the next datacamp course you will learn more about the package `dplyr`. For now we just give you some code. You can run the following script.

First, we want to make _Health\_status_ a factor instead of a character

```{r}
data2 <- data2 %>%
  mutate(Health_status = as.numeric(Health_status))
str(data2)
```

Then, we want to count the number of healthy and unhealthy males and females

```{r}
data3 <- data2 %>%
  group_by(Gender, Health_status) %>%
 summarise(Count_observations = n()) %>%
  mutate(Health_status=as.factor(Health_status))

data3
```

## Assignment 2

Recreate with the dataframe "data3" the following barchart ![](../Sourcedata/barchart.png)

* Hint: see for changing the [legends and colors](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/)
* Hint: the "green" color is in fact the color "greenyellow"
* Hint: see for the [themes](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html): 


```{r}
ggplot(data3, aes(Gender, Count_observations)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = Health_status), position = 'dodge') +
xlab("Gender") +
ylab("number") +
ggtitle("Health male & female") + 
theme_classic() +
scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "greenyellow"),
                      name="Health status",
                      breaks=c(0, 1),
                      labels=c("Healthy", "Unhealthy"))
  
```
